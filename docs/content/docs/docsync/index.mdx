DocSync is a CRDT-agnostic synchronization protocol designed to work with any CRDT library including DocNode, Yjs, Loro, and others.

For the story behind DocNode and DocSync, see [About](/about).

## Key Features

- **CRDT Agnostic**: Works with any CRDT library without inspecting operation contents
- **Real-time Sync**: Efficient real-time synchronization across clients
- **Offline Support**: Built-in support for offline-first applications

## Coming Soon

Documentation for DocSync is actively being developed.

TODO: make a diagram of the architecture: BroadcastChannel, IndexedDB, Server, Client, presence, operations, etc.
