## Frequently Asked Questions

<Accordions type="single" collapsible>

<Accordion title="What is the current status of the project?" id="status">

**DocNode** is very mature and in beta. The API is stable, though minor changes may occur before v1.0. CRDT mode is not implemented yet.

**DocSync** is in active development. Core features like real-time sync, persistence, and reconnection are working. Advanced features like autoscaling, sharding, and encryption are on the roadmap. `@docukit/docsync` has not yet been released on npm, but private distributions are offered upon request.

We're looking for early adopters to help shape the product. [Contact us](/contact) for a demo and to discuss your needs.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does DocNode and DocSync compare to Yjs?" id="compare-to-yjs">

You can think of DocNode as an alternative to Yjs.

On the other hand, DocSync would be to DocNode what [Hocuspocus](https://tiptap.dev/docs/hocuspocus/introduction) or [Y-Sweet](https://jamsocket.com/y-sweet) are to Yjs.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I try Sync before committing?" id="trial">

Yes! You can try it for free in non-production environments.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to request a license to use DocSync? What if my use is non-commercial or I'm pre-revenue?" id="request-license">

Yes, all production use requires a license.

If your app is pre-revenue or non-commercial, you can request a free license. Once you start generating revenue, you'll need to upgrade to a commercial license.

[Contact us](/contact) to request your license.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does the pricing work? What happens if my revenues grow or fall?" id="pricing">

We evaluate each case to ensure that pricing is accessible and reasonable for all companies at any stage of their development.

Please get in touch so we can give you a quote.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do you offer DocSync as a cloud-based service or a hosted solution?" id="cloud-based-service">

At the moment, we only offer the possibility of self-hosting under license. In the future, we may offer a managed hosting option.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What things can I do and what things can't I do with DocNode?" id="do-and-dont-do-with-core">

The DocNode license is very permissive and is designed so that you can use it free of charge for any purpose, except those that compete with the business model of `@docukit/docsync`.

You can use DocNode to:

- Create local-first or real-time collaborative applications.
- Monetize these applications.
- Create and distribute DocNode-based libraries that are not substantially similar to or compete with the `@docukit/docsync` library. For example: DocNode-based data structures such as grids or rich text editors, or utilities for rendering documents in different UI frameworks.

You can't use DocNode to:

- Distribute software that offers the same or substantially similar functionality as `@docukit/docsync`, such as libraries that synchronize or persist document state across multiple clients or storage systems.
- Offer any hosted or cloud-based service to third parties that provides the same or substantially similar functionality as `@docukit/docsync`, unless you have an explicit license from the copyright holder.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I develop my own sync solution?" id="develop-own-sync">

Yes. You are free to develop your own solution that synchronizes documents between multiple clients and stores them in your own databases for internal or personal use.

What you can't do is distribute it to third parties or commercialize it as a document synchronization solution (e.g., as a cloud-based service).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I read the license?" id="read-license">

DocNode has a dual license model:

**DocNode packages** are distributed under the [DocNode License](https://github.com/docnode/docnode/blob/main/packages/docnode/LICENSE.md). This license allows commercial and non-commercial use with minimal restrictions to protect our Sync offering, following the [Fair Code](https://faircode.io) principles.

**DocSync packages** are proprietary software distributed under the [DocSync License](https://github.com/docnode/docnode/blob/main/packages/docsync/LICENSE.md). You can view the source code and use it for evaluation or personal non-production projects, but to use it in production you must request a license.

Please refer to the actual license files for complete terms.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I contribute to the project?" id="contribute">

Absolutely! We welcome contributions to all parts of DocNode. DocNode is source-available, and we're happy to accept PRs, bug reports, and feature requests. Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/docnode/docnode).
